# Newspaper Sentiment Analysis on Cancer Medication

This repository contains code for an NLP project analyzing the sentiment of Dutch newspaper articles about cancer medication. The project was initially started as part of a potential publication, but its continuation is uncertain.  

Three NLP approaches were explored:
1. **Pretrained sentiment classifier** – trained on Dutch book reviews.
2. **Natural Language Inference (NLI) models** – using hypothesis and entailment.
3. **Generative models** – such as Llama and GPT.

Llama 3.3 70B produced results most similar to human annotations.
